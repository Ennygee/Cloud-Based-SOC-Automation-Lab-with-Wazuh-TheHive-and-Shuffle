# Cloud-Based SOC Automation Lab with Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle

## Overview
This project guides users in building a cloud-based **SOC Automation Lab** using tools like **Wazuh** for threat detection (XDR/SIM), **TheHive** for case management, and **Shuffle** for SOAR automation. This lab is ideal for gaining hands-on cybersecurity experience and is compatible with cloud services, making it accessible even for users with Mac M1, M2, and M3 chips.

## Objective
The project helps users create and automate a SOC lab from scratch using cloud services. The lab integrates advanced security tools like **Wazuh**, **TheHive**, and **Shuffle**, enabling practical experience in building, scaling, and automating SOC processes.

## Skills Learned
- Configuring cloud-based SOC infrastructure.
- Installing and setting up **Wazuh**, **TheHive**, and **Shuffle**.
- Automating incident response workflows.
- Scripting for process automation in security operations.
- Generating and analyzing telemetry for threat detection.

## Tools Used
- **Wazuh**: Security monitoring (XDR/SIM).
- **TheHive**: Case management for tracking incidents.
- **Shuffle**: SOAR tool for automating workflows.
- **SquareX**: Disposable web browsers, emails, and file viewers for secure investigations.
- **Cloud Services**: Hosting the SOC lab and scaling it as required.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Cloud Setup**: Overcome challenges with cloud resources to ensure proper communication between components.
- **Automation Scripting**: Write automation scripts to enhance workflow efficiency in the SOC.

## Results
- Successfully built a cloud-based SOC lab with real-time telemetry, threat detection, and automation using **Shuffle**.
- Integrated Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle for complete SOC operations and incident management.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience in SOC automation and cloud-based security operations.
- Improved coding and automation skills in incident response workflows.

## Next Steps
- Scale the lab with more endpoints and refine automation rules in **Shuffle**.
- Explore further telemetry generation and improve incident playbooks for faster response.
